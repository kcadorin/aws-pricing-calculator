# Code Structure

## Data Flow
1. User starts the application with [run.py](mdc:run.py)
2. The main interface in [src/app.py](mdc:src/app.py) is loaded
3. User selects AWS services and configures parameters
4. Cost calculations are performed using functions from [src/aws_services.py](mdc:src/aws_services.py)
5. Results are displayed in the interface and can be exported

## Application Structure
- **User Interface**: Implemented with Streamlit in [src/app.py](mdc:src/app.py)
  - Sidebar menu for service selection
  - Forms for parameter configuration
  - Tables and charts for result visualization
  
- **Business Logic**: Implemented in [src/aws_services.py](mdc:src/aws_services.py)
  - Functions to estimate AWS service prices
  - Calculations based on approximate price tables
  - Optional access to AWS Cost Explorer for comparison

- **Execution**: Managed by [run.py](mdc:run.py)
  - Virtual environment verification
  - Dependency installation
  - Streamlit application initialization
